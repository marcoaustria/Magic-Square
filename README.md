# Magic-Square
Project for COP3503 Programming Fundamentals 2

ASSIGNMENT:

Write a C++ program that creates three (3) different N*N magic squares.  

A squarematrix is the arrangement of the numbers 1, 2, , , in which the sum of rows, columns, and diagonals are the same. 

The users (i.e., TAs) will specify the size of the square matrix:N. 

The value N must be an odd number between 3 and 15.
